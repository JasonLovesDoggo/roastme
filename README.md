## üíª Usage

### Basic Usage

Simply run:

### Advanced Usage

```bash

roastme --deep

# Configure your AI provider settings
roastme config
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

RoastMe supports multiple AI providers, with Google Gemini set as the default. You can configure your preferred provider in two ways:

### 1. Interactive Configuration

Run the configuration UI:

```bash
roastme config
```

This will open an interactive terminal UI where you can:
- Select your preferred AI provider (local, Google Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, or custom)
- Enter your API credentials
- Set model preferences

### 2. Manual Configuration

Edit `~/.roastme.toml`:

```toml
[ai]
provider = "gemini" # Options: local, gemini, openai, anthropic, custom

[ai.openai]
api_key = "your-openai-api-key"
base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"

[ai.gemini]
api_key = "your-gemini-api-key"
base_url = "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com"
model = "gemini-pro"

[ai.anthropic]
api_key = "your-anthropic-api-key"
base_url = "https://api.anthropic.com"
model = "claude-2"

[ai.custom]
api_key = "your-custom-api-key"
base_url = "https://api.your-provider.com"
model = "your-model"

[ui]
colorTheme = "dark" # Options: dark, light
style = "rounded"   # Options: rounded, double, thick
```

## üîé What RoastMe Analyzes

RoastMe looks for patterns in your command history, including:

- **Repeated commands** - Are you running the same command over and over?
- **Failed commands** - Typos and error patterns
- **Complex commands** - Extremely long one-liners or pipe chains
- **Indecision** - Excessive use of cd, ls, and other navigation commands
- **Time wasters** - Commands that access time-wasting websites
- **Skill level** - Command complexity to determine your terminal proficiency
