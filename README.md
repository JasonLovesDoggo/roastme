## 📖 Overview

terminal habits. 

Whether you're making the same typos, using excessively complex commands, or spending too much time on social media sites through the terminal, RoastMe will call you out with style.

## 🚀 Installation

### Using Go

```bash
go install github.com/jasonlovesdoggo/roastme@latest
```

### Pre-built binaries

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/jasonlovesdoggo/roastme/releases/latest) for your platform.

## 💻 Usage

### Basic Usage

Simply run:

```bash
roastme
```

This will analyze your recent command history and generate a humorous roast using the local (non-AI) engine.

### Advanced Usage

```bash
# Get a deeper analysis of your command history
roastme --deep

# Configure your AI provider settings
roastme config
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

RoastMe supports multiple AI providers, with Google Gemini set as the default. You can configure your preferred provider in two ways:

### 1. Interactive Configuration

Run the configuration UI:

```bash
roastme config
```

This will open an interactive terminal UI where you can:
- Select your preferred AI provider (local, Google Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, or custom)
- Enter your API credentials
- Set model preferences

### 2. Manual Configuration

Edit `~/.roastme.toml`:

```toml
[ai]
provider = "gemini" # Options: local, gemini, openai, anthropic, custom

[ai.openai]
api_key = "your-openai-api-key"
base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"

[ai.gemini]
api_key = "your-gemini-api-key"
base_url = "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com"
model = "gemini-pro"

[ai.anthropic]
api_key = "your-anthropic-api-key"
base_url = "https://api.anthropic.com"
model = "claude-2"

[ai.custom]
api_key = "your-custom-api-key"
base_url = "https://api.your-provider.com"
model = "your-model"

[ui]
colorTheme = "dark" # Options: dark, light
style = "rounded"   # Options: rounded, double, thick
```

## 🔎 What RoastMe Analyzes

RoastMe looks for patterns in your command history, including:

- **Repeated commands** - Are you running the same command over and over?
- **Failed commands** - Typos and error patterns
- **Complex commands** - Extremely long one-liners or pipe chains
- **Indecision** - Excessive use of cd, ls, and other navigation commands
- **Time wasters** - Commands that access time-wasting websites
- **Skill level** - Command complexity to determine your terminal proficiency
